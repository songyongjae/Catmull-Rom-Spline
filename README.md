# Real-Time Object Detection with Yolov8 in Industrial Environments

This study focuses on training Yolov8 models using robot video data from real-world corporate processes through open-source platforms to achieve **real-time object detection**. We propose an **optimization method** that improves data extraction by tracking, annotating, and interpolating detected motion data. 

YOLO (You Only Look Once), which predicts multiple bounding boxes and class probabilities simultaneously using a **convolutional neural network (CNN)**, excels in speed by formulating object detection as a regression problem. This methodology provides significant advantages in standardized industrial environments by efficiently detecting numerous objects.

## Key Features
- **Real-Time Performance**: Utilizing Yolov8 for high-speed object detection.
- **Data Optimization**: Enhanced data extraction through tracking, annotation, and interpolation.
- **Robust Methodology**: Designed for standardized industrial environments to detect multiple objects simultaneously.

## Methodology Highlights
- **Tracking and Annotation**: Accurate motion data extraction from robot video footage.
- **Interpolation Using Catmull-Rom Splines**: Smooth and precise motion data representation.
- **Yolov8 Advantage**: Superior speed and efficiency due to regression-based object detection.

## Keywords
- **Object Detection**
